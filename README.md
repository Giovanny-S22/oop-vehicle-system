A base class `Vehiculo` is extended by specialized classes such as `Moto` and `Bus`. The program allows interaction through the console, including increasing vehicle speed with validation against maximum speed limits.

## Concepts Applied
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Constructors and super()
- Method overriding
- User input handling with Scanner
